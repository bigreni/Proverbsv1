        <li>
                <h3 class='proverbTitle'>"Qui vivra verra."</h3>
                A widely used and understood proverb that literally means, “He/she who lives, shall see.” This phrase is usually used when an outcome is unpredictable or uncertain, like in the English “the future will tell.”<br>
                </li>
                <li>
                <h3 class='proverbTitle'>"L’habit ne fait pas le moine."</h3>
                Translates to “The vestment does not make the monk.” Its significance, though, is that just because a monk is wearing a renunciate’s robe, it doesn’t mean that the monk is sincere in his intentions. The English equivalent would be, “Don’t judge a book by its cover.” The sense of the phrase implies that appearances can sometimes mislead one’s better judgement.<br>
                </li>
                <li>
                <h3 class='proverbTitle'>"Chacun voit midi à sa porte."</h3>
                The literal translation goes, “Everyone sees noon at his doorstep.” It means that every individual is occupied, first and foremost, with his or her own personal interests, and each feels their subjective opinions as objective truths.<br>
                </li>
                <li>
                <h3 class='proverbTitle'>"Mieux vaut prévenir que guérir."</h3>
                It literally means, “It is better to prevent than to heal,” and interestingly, it’s the first principle of traditional Chinese healing practices. The French are very attached to this saying, dearly using it on a regular basis. It is not surprising, however, since health is first priority – “Et d’abord, ne pas nuire!” (First, do no harm!), they say. The sense of the proverb is such that it is better to take the necessary precautions to prevent a sickness, than to have to treat and heal this sickness.<br>
                </li>
                <li>
                <h3 class='proverbTitle'>"Petit a petit, l’oiseau fait son nid."</h3>
                A charming little phrase that’s widely applied, and translated as, “Little by little, the bird makes its nest.” This proverb designates patience and perseverance.<br>
                </li>
                <li>
                <h3 class='proverbTitle'>"Qui court deux lievres a la fois, n’en prend aucun."</h3>
                It is translated as, “Who runs after two hares at the same time, catches none.” The meaning is that an individual ought to concentrate on one task at a time with optimal attention, if that task is to be well done. If a person does two things at once, the likelihood is that the end result will be anchored in mediocrity, due to a half-hearted effort. Something well done is something done with total concentration.<br>
                </li>
                <li>
                <h3 class='proverbTitle'>"Qui n’avance pas, recule."</h3>
                 It is translated as, “Who does not move forward, recedes”. There can be no standstill in life, only evolution or devolution. Either one evolves, or one devolves. To be stagnant is the same as to recede.<br>
                </li>
                <li>
                <h3 class='proverbTitle'>"Quand on a pas ce que l’on aime, il faut aimer ce que l’on a."</h3>
                Its translation is, “When one doesn’t have the things that one loves, one must love what one has.” It reflects the saying, “Want what you have and you’ll have what you want,” which is to say that you must be content with what you currently hold, however little it may be.<br>
                </li>
                <li>
                <h3 class='proverbTitle'>"Il n’y a pas plus sourd que celui qui ne veut pas entendre."</h3>
                It translates as, “No one is as deaf as the one who does not want to listen.” This would be the case for very stubborn people, or those so caught up in their own self-assertions that they pay no heed to the advice or opinions of others.<br>
                </li>
                <li>
                <h3 class='proverbTitle'>"Qui sème le vent, récolte la tempête."</h3>
                He who sows the wind shall reap the tempest. (As you sow, so you shall reap.)<br>
                <br class='clearfix'>
                </li>
                <li>
                <h3 class='proverbTitle'>"C’est l’exception qui confirme la règle."</h3>
                It’s the exception that proves the rule.<br>
                </li>
                <li>
                <h3 class='proverbTitle'>"La raison du plus fort est toujours la meilleure."</h3>
                The motive of the strongest is always the best. (Might is always right.)<br>
                </li>
                <li>
                <h3 class='proverbTitle'>"Il faut manger pour vivre, et non pas vivre pour manger."</h3>
                One must eat to live, and not live to eat.<br>
                </li>
                <li>
                <h3 class='proverbTitle'>"Revenons à nos moutons."</h3>
                Translated as “Let us get back to our sheep" that means let’s get back to what we were saying/doing.<br>
                </li>
                <li>
                <h3 class='proverbTitle'>"Il ne faut pas se fier aux apparences."</h3>
                One must not trust appearances. Things are not always as they look like.<br>
                </li>
                <li>
                <h3 class='proverbTitle'>"Petit poisson deviendra grand."</h3>
                The little fish will grow big. Translated as tall oaks from little acorns grow/Boys will be men one day.<br>
                </li>
                <li>
                <h3 class='proverbTitle'>"Les bons comptes font les bons amis."</h3>
                Good accounts make good friends. Translated as short reckonings make long friends/Neither a borrower nor a lender be.<br>
                </li>
                <li>
                <h3 class='proverbTitle'>"La nuit porte conseil."</h3>
                Translated as the night brings advice. It means to sleep on it. Take the advice of your pillow.<br>
                </li>
